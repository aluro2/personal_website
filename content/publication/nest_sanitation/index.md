  abstract = "Hosts of avian brood parasites have evolved diverse defenses to avoid the costs associated with raising brood parasite nestlings. In egg ejection, the host recognizes and removes foreign eggs laid in its nest. Nest sanitation, a behavior similar in motor pattern to egg ejection, has been proposed repeatedly as a potential pre-adaptation to egg ejection. Here, we separately placed blue 3D-printed, brown-headed cowbird (*Molothrus ater*) eggs known to elicit interindividual variation in ejection responses and semi-natural leaves into American robinsâ€™ (*Turdus migratorius*) nests to test proximate predictions that (1) rejecter hosts should sanitize debris from nests more frequently and consistently than accepter hosts and (2) hosts that sanitize their nests of debris prior to the presentation of a foreign egg will be more likely to eject the foreign egg. Egg ejection responses were highly repeatable within individuals yet variable between them, but were not influenced by prior exposure to debris, nor related to sanitation tendencies as a whole, because nearly all individuals sanitized their nests. Additionally, we collected published data for eight different host species to test for a potential positive correlation between sanitation and egg ejection. We found no significant correlation between nest sanitation and egg ejection rates; however, our comparative analysis was limited to a sample size of 8, and we advise that more data from additional species are necessary to properly address interspecific tests of the pre-adaptation hypothesis. In lack of support for the nest sanitation hypothesis, our study suggests that, within individuals, foreign egg ejection is distinct from nest sanitation tendencies, and sanitation and foreign egg ejection may not correlate across species."
  
  abstract_short = "Interspecific avian brood parasites lay their eggs into the nests of different host species. Many hosts can recognize the eggs of unrelated brood parasites in their nests and physically remove them using their bills. A common hypothesis for the development and evolution of egg rejection behavior of brood parasite hosts is that birds that display nest cleaning behavior may have a greater propensity to remove anything from their nests that does not resemble their own eggs, including foreign eggs of unrelated brood parasites. Results from field experiments with American robins and a comparative meta-analysis of a handful of brood parasite host species suggests that the 'nest sanitation' hypothesis does not adequately explain the likelihood of removing foreign eggs from the nest by individual hosts nor the evolution of egg rejection behavior in brood parasite hosts. Given these results, we suggest the 'nest sanitation' hypothesis should be viewed with much more scrutiny going forward."
