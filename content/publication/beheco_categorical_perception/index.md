  abstract = "Categorical perception is a timely topic worth exploring for behavioral ecologists and Green et al. (2020) provide a current perspective of its history, recent developments, and valuable future directions. We emphasize the necessity of testing for categorical perception in study systems where its effects on fitness can be measured or estimated. Categorical perception may prove to be widespread among animals, and behavioral ecologists have a unique opportunity to test categorical perception in diverse ecological and evolutionary contexts."
