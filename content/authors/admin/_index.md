I am a researcher studying how visual perception and color influences behavior in birds. My current work focuses on offspring recognition in hosts of brood parasites, mate recognition and choice in American robins (*Turdus migratorius*), and the evolution of plumage sexual dichromatism in *Turdus* thrushes. Much of my research involves the use of spectroscopy, modeling of avian vision, and using a variety of statistical approaches to answer why animals look and behave the way they do.
